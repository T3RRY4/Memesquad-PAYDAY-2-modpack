ENHANCED HITMARKERS:

Put entire folder "Enhanced hitmarkers" in mod_overrides. That's right, in mod_overrides, not mods like you did with the mod itself. You don't have to copy "Overwatch hitmarkers", it does nothing when you use that mod.
It has to ask you to merge folders, otherwise you didn't do it right and it's gonna do absolutely nothing.

If you don't have your own "Enhanced hitmarkers" folder in mod_overrides it means that either you don't use the mod, in which case you just wasted your time 
or it means you didn't try to set it up for the first time yet. Do that and then bother with installing that.


EXTRA HITMARKERS:

Basically, rename any of the files inside for whichever hitmarkers you wanna use to "hitconfirm" and "hitconfirm_crit" and then overwrite the originals.
Includes 3 different colors: normal (greyish-white), red and yellow-orange (color taken from original crit hitmarker).
They also allow for different sizes of the hitmarkers, because why the fuck not, I realize not everyone likes giant symbols flying all over the screen. 
You want small hitmarker for normal hits and huge for crits? Knock yourself out, completely up to you, pick and choose what you want.

For reference: default ingame hitmarker has a size of 16x16 pixels, the white-greyish one you saw on my screens and gifs is size 40x40, red crit is 48x48. You're gonna figure it out, I'm sure. 

Worst case - go with trial and error. You can even ALT+TAB and replace files without closing the game, it works.
